        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p class="webdev-text">After initially coming from more of a background in music technology, it was almost by accident that I started my journey towards a very different area
          of the tech industry. However, ever since I got my first taste of the developer world, I've been firmly bitten by (de)bug!
          <br><br>
          In August 2019, I was fortunate enough to attend a 3-week software development course in the heart of Manchester, UK. It was there that I learnt some of the foundational
          aspects about coding and I've barely stopped to look back.
          <br><br>
          To enable myself to expand on the knowledge I gained whilst there, I have more recently bought several online developer courses. My aim is to use the variety of front and
          backend programming languages they contain and amalgamate them to build up a portfolio of projects to evidence my abilities. The hope is that this will improve my general
          understanding about what it takes to become a developer as a paid professional and ultimately assist in providing me the opportunity to become one.
