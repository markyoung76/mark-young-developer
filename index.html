      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">I'm a self-taught developer based in Manchester. I've a huge interest in becoming a professional full-stack software developer
        and I'm currently studying hard to do so via a self-directed boot camp.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p class="webdev-text">After initially coming from more of a background in music technology, it was almost by accident that I started my journey towards a very different area
          of the tech industry. However, ever since I got my first taste of the developer world, I've been firmly bitten by (de)bug!
          <br><br>
          In August 2019, I was fortunate enough to attend a 3-week software development course in the heart of Manchester, UK. It was there that I learnt some of the foundational
          aspects about coding and I've barely stopped to look back.
          <br><br>
          To enable myself to expand on the knowledge I gained whilst there, I have more recently bought several online developer courses. My aim is to use the variety of front and
          backend programming languages they contain and amalgamate them to build up a portfolio of projects to evidence my abilities. The hope is that this will improve my general
          understanding about what it takes to become a developer as a paid professional and ultimately assist in providing me the opportunity to become one.

        <h3>Digital Design</h3>
        <p class="digidesign-text">I've always been a deeply creative individual at heart, from a very young age. It is my eventual wish to be able to combine my long-lasting interests
          in art, design and music with my newfound passion for web development.
          <br><br>
          When I'm not busy coding, I use my iPad Pro 12" and an iOS app called, 'Procreate' (designed by Savage Interactive Pty Ltd) to design an extensive collection of my own unique
          foil lamination artwork. I've included three of my hand-drawn pieces, in digital format, on this web page (I created one of the circular icons in this section especially
          for it - called, 'The .developer Brain'). The other two were already part of a vast selection I've been establishing over the past two years.
          <br><br>
          I eventually intend to build my own ecommerce web site to display and potentially sell them as decorative foiled items. As they say, watch this space and there will be
          more to come further down the line! For now though, my focus is particularly centred around honing my developer capabilities as a priority.
          <br><br>
          I designed the images for this website from scratch and it is a desire of mine to become lucky enough to incorporate my artistic skills within a web developer role, if and
          when possible.

        <h3>Music Production</h3>
        <p class="musicprod-text">So, you've perhaps already gathered from the above about just how much I love all things creative, well, music production and generally all things
          music related are no exception. Who doesn't find music to be important within their lives? After all, it is the one universal language that we can all fully appreciate and
          understand! It was around 2007, in particular, that I found a different way of accessing my deep-seated love for music. This was done by embarking on a music degree
          course at Derby University, UK, as a mature student... </p>
